# Self-Supervised Learning of time series data

## T_CPC.py
model with temporal encodings; least modified from the provided model used in the paper


## ( CPC_all.py )
produces PCA graph and less relevant training metrics for interpreting the training of the CPC model


## TS_CPC.py
model with temporal spectral encodings; suggested new model


## ( TS_all.py )
produces PCA graph and less relevant training metrics for interpreting the training of the TS model


## S_CPC.py
model with spectral encodings only; to compare with the others


## linearclassifier_all.py
implements two different linear classification methods in addition to the training and testing of the model
produces relevant metrics to evaluate the training quality



## before training.ipynb
no training done.

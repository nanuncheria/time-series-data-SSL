# Self-Supervised Learning of time series data

## T_CPC.py
model with temporal encodings; least modified from the provided model used in the paper

## TS_CPC.py
model with temporal spectral encodings; suggested new model

## S_CPC.py
model with spectral encodings only; to compare with the others


## linearclassifier_all.py
implements two different linear classification methods in addition to the training and testing of the model
produces relevant metrics to evaluate the training quality



## before training.ipynb
no training done.
